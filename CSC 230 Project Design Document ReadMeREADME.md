# Projects-Testing
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a software developer with a number of small titles that they have designed and want to extend.  
This was the primary purpose of our contract with them: to extend and adapt their existing projects to other operating platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I am particularly proud of my UML diagram that I build during this project.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a software design document was great for working out precisely what the client was asking for in development terms, 
and breaking these goals down into particular projects.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would re-assess some of my documentation during the Evaluation phase of the project.
There were some assessments that I made on Linux and Mac that after further research I felt were inaccurate.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I examined how I would normally access most of my own equipment on a daily basis, and how that might influence the interaction and performance of a given program.
Understanding the end-user’s perspective helps to create a seamless experience when using a piece of software and can prevent some bugs or issues that typically 
arise from user error.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software as a set of goals and problems to solve, and then broke these down into discrete tasks.  I would recommend 
keeping a design document of some sort to keep track of goal-posts and any problems or solutions that may arise during development, 
and to keep track of overall progress.
